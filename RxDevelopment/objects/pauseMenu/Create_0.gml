LeukFacts = ["Cancer is when cells in your body start to grow out of control!\n Usually, cells divide with strict supervision from your body and genes.\n However, cancerous cells are able to slip around these controls.\n It is also why cancerous cells tend to live longer than normal cells.",
"Leukemia is a cancer of cells that would normally become blood cells,\n like Red Blood Cells, Platelets, or White Blood Cells.",
"There are four main types of Leukemia:\n Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL),\n Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),\n Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),\n and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)",
"The basic baddies you see here are cancerous white blood cells, or LYMPHOCYTES.\n This indicates that you, Rose, most likely have Acute LYMPHOCYTIC Leukemia.\n This is the most common leukemia seen in pediatric patients such as yourself.",
"There are a few symptoms that mean you could have Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia:\n Feeling tired, weak, dizzy or lightheaded,\n Shortness of breath, Pale skin, Infections that donâ€™t go away or keep coming back,\n Bruises (or small red or purple spots) on the skin, frequent/severe nosebleeds,\n enlarged lymph nodes, a bigger belly, or pain in your bones/joints.",
"Leukemia can be treated with chemotherapy (chemo).\n In chemo, a cancer-fighting drug is injected into the body.\n These drugs are given in cycles,\n with a rest period in between treatments to let the body recover.\n Treating Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia usually means low doses of chemo over 2-3 years.",
"Once you've completed your chemotherapy, Rose, us doctors\n will have to keep an eye on you for around the next five years,\n making sure this dumb cancer stays away!\n This also means that if you or your parents have any questions,\n we'll be here to help you and answer them!"];
